# Why Crunch? 

Online surveys have become ubiquitous. But in practice there are barriers and frustration to making use of the data:

- How do I download my data?
- How do I analyze my data in R/Stata/Python?

Further in practice, we often face frustrations like:

- "What question was `CC_321AH_vt` again?""
- Do I put my figures in PDF? PNG? Document in PDF? Word? PPT?
- What if a colleague has follow-up questions?
- After all this manipulation, how can I keep attributes like labels, question wordings, and display formats as shown?


Crunch is a online-based tool recently built to facilitate such collaboration.

# Crunch Use-Cases

Some firms use Crunch to manage internal analytics, and/or showcase them for dissemination.

"Editors" can upload their own survey data (e.g. from Qualtrics or Survey Monkey) as `.csv` or `.sav` (SPSS) files. See for example:  <https://cces.gov.harvard.edu/explore>


# Logging in to the APSA Grad Hackathon Dataset

1. Sign up for a Crunch account
1. Make sure John Ray or Shiro Kuriwaki gets your email 
1. Sign-in to your account, and you should see `"Graduate Student APSA Hackathon Team Survey"`^[If not, try this link after making an account: <https://app.crunch.io/dataset/2c7c25d41367416c82560928cc0ee258>]


# GUI for Browsing

Machine-Readable is not necessary Human-Readable.  Friction occurs for example when 

- The same variable should be named `pid_3` for data analysis, but named `"Partisan Identity (3-point)"` for presentation
- "Grid questions" are separated into columns in a flat file (`Q1_A`, `Q1_B`, `Q1_C`), but should be presented back in its grid form
- Variables come in the order they were presented, but a re-grouped order might be easier to navigate.

# GUI for Analyzing

Tailored specifically for surveys, Crunch has intuitive GUIs for

- Top-lines
- Cross-tabs
- Figures
- Analyzing by Subset

Also has survey-specific functionalities such as 

- Switching between weights
- Grouping response choices

# GUI for Sharing

Crunch Editors can create html widgets of their datasets, that users can engage with (without releasing all raw data).

# Scripting by R

You can also extract, view, and edit Crunch datasets from the R package `crunch`. 

![The crunch R package](images/package-website.png)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("crunch")
```


Detailed step-by-step vignettes and help page exist to set up your password for easy login

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(crunch)
login()
```

Once logged in, loading a crunch dataset allows you to extract variables and tables from the R object:

```{r}
ds <- loadDataset("Graduate Student APSA Hackathon Team Survey",
                  project = "APSA Hackathon")
```


familiar base-R syntax applies:
```{r}
table(ds$Q6)
```

or through more of `crunch`'s functions:
```{r}
crtabs(~ Q6, ds)
```



For an example of a R script that formats an existing crunch object that originated from a user-uploaded SPSS file, see <https://github.com/kuriwaki/cces_cumulative/blob/master/07_format-crunch.R>
